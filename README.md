Unscaled is a pirture of the unscaled HfSe2 plotted on the base cell of the HfSe2 band structure. By implementing the scaling code it will be scaled to follow the scaled jpg where the base cell and supercells are aligned perfectly. This is also proven by printing the k-points and comparing the k-points to the corresponding base cell
